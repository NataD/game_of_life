# Game of Life

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced "players", by creating patterns with particular properties.

In this project, a user needs to provide a number of rows and columns to generate a field where depending on the initial conditions, the cells will form various patterns throughout the course of the game.
There are also two buttons (play and pause) that allow to control the game.
